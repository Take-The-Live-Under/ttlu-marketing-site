    question: "How does TakeTheLiveUnder actually work?",
    answer:
      "We track live NCAA basketball games and crunch the numbers in real-time. When the pace of the game suggests the final score will land under the line, we flag it with a Golden Zone alert and give you a confidence score so you know how strong the signal is.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need to understand stats or analytics?",
    answer:
      "Not at all. We designed the dashboard for regular sports fans, not data scientists. You see a game, a signal (Golden Zone or not), and a confidence score. Green means strong, yellow means worth watching. That's it.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the Golden Zone?",
    answer:
      "The Golden Zone is our signature alert. It fires when the game pace and score trends strongly favor the under. Think of it as a heads-up that the numbers are in your corner -- it's not a guarantee, but it's a well-informed signal.",
  },
  {
    question: "Does this guarantee I'll win?",
    answer:
      "No tool can guarantee that. Sports are unpredictable -- that's what makes them exciting. TakeTheLiveUnder gives you an edge by surfacing real-time insights, but the final call is always yours.",
  },
  {
    question: "What games do you cover?",
    answer:
      "We cover NCAA Division I men's basketball -- every regular season game, conference tournaments, and the big dance (March Madness). If it's being played, we're watching it.",
  },
  {
    question: "How often does the data refresh?",
    answer:
      "Every 15 seconds during live games. That's fast enough to catch momentum shifts as they happen, but smooth enough that you're not overwhelmed by a firehose of numbers.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is this connected to the NCAA?",
    answer:
      "No. TakeTheLiveUnder is a fully independent analytics product. We are not affiliated with, endorsed by, or connected to the NCAA or any college athletics program.",
  },
